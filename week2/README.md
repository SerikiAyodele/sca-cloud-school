## Prerequisites

## How It Works
 * I created 2 functions,one to calculate the average age of the female's from the user.txt file
   and the other to calculate the average age of the male's from the user.txt file
   
 * I used a while loop and for loop to read the file and perform operations and the data
 
 * AWK was very important and convinient for my code to work, i used this in my for loop
  to get the third column which contain the data i needed to calculate the average, i also used AWK
  for th calculation.

## Issues that might be encountered
none, pretty basic
